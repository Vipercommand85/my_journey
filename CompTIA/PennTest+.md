## Section 2: Planning and Engagement
### Planning a Pen Test
* **PERMISSION IS ESSENTIAL FOR ANY ETHICAL PENTEST**
* knowing how much work will need to be done to complete the requirements
  - do not do more than you've planned for

#### [Penetration Testing Execution Standard](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page)

### Rules of Engagement
* pay attention to target audience
 - who is sponsoring the pen test
 - what is the purpose of the test
 - **PCI DSS** : Payment Industry Data Security Standard
* these govern the pen tester's activites
* test scope
 - technical/physical/personnel
* internal/external communication
 - inherent risks with these tests
 - crashing devices, services, whole servers
 - corrupting data
 - degrading perfomance/avialibility of services resulting in Terms of Service (TOS)/regulation/legislation violation
* know who to contact on a per issue basis in a timely manner

### Regulatory Compliance
[**PCI DSS**](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Penetration-Testing-Guidance-v1_1.pdf): industry standard of security requirements for payment card processing
PCI DSS requirement 11
: intermnal and external testing that is carried out by the following triggers
