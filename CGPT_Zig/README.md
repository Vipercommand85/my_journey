# ChatGPT developed exercises to help me learn core principles of Zig programming language

## Week 1: Core Language Basics

### Goal: Get comfortable with variables, functions, loops, conditionals.

* Day 1 → Hello World + simple math (add, subtract, multiply, divide).

* Day 2 → Temperature Converter (C ↔ F).

* Day 3 → FizzBuzz (1–100).

* Day 4 → Prime Checker.

* Day 5 → Factorial (loop and recursion).

* Day 6 → Test blocks (test "factorial").

* Day 7 → Mini-review: combine prime + factorial into a menu program.

## Week 2: Arrays, Slices, Structs, Enums

### Goal: Model data, use arrays/slices.

* Day 8 → Reverse a String (array indexing).

* Day 9 → Largest Number in an array.

* Day 10 → Sum of Even Numbers.

* Day 11 → Point struct + Distance function.

* Day 12 → Student struct array (store 3 students, print).

* Day 13 → Traffic Light enum simulation.

* Day 14 → Mini-review: write a small bank account simulator (struct: account, deposit/withdraw).

## Week 3: Errors, Memory, Problem-Solving

### Goal: Learn Zig’s error system and memory model.

* Day 15 → Safe Division (!i32).

* Day 16 → File Reader (print contents, handle errors).

* Day 17 → Palindrome Checker.

* Day 18 → Bubble Sort (manual).

* Day 19 → Use std.sort.sort.

* Day 20 → Dynamic Array with std.heap.page_allocator.

* Day 21 → Review: Word Frequency Counter (hash map).

## Week 4: Capstones & Systems Thinking

### Goal: Combine everything, think in larger projects.

* Day 22 → Command-Line Calculator.

* Day 23 → Todo List Manager (struct + file save/load).

* Day 24 → Logger with levels (enum).

* Day 25 → Bitwise Flags (permissions example).

* Day 26 → Simple Allocator wrapper.

* Day 27 → Mini Snake Game (console-based).

* Day 28 → Review day: polish Snake Game or Todo List.

* Day 29 → Reflection: document what you learned in a .md file.

* Day 30 → Pick a personal project idea (text adventure, puzzle solver, file tool) and sketch it.
* I have already begun a journey to create an ERP solution in Zig.
* I have a repo for this already, called **ZERP (Zig Enterprise Resource Planning)**
