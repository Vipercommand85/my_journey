## MY JOURNEY

Hello,

My name is Mike and this is a documentation of my journey into tech and programming.
I have attended a community college and have completed enough credits for an Assoc in Cyber Security, Information Technology, and Mechanical Engineering.
I have certificates of completion in PLC programming as well as auto motive technology, but that was from a different school, ATC.
