## Task 1: Introduction
* **Vulnerability**: is defined by NIST as "_A weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source_"

## Learning Objectives
1. Vulnerability management vs Vulnerability Scanning
2. How are vulnerabilites classified?
3. Process of vulnerability management lifecycle
4. How can we use a vulnerability management framework in cybersecurity


## Task 2: Vulnerability Management vs Vulnerability Scanning
### Vulnerabilty Management
* is an ongoing, proactive, & frequent autmated activity
* it protects computer systems, networks, & enterprise solutions from cyberattacks & data breaches

### Vulnerability Scanning
* is surrounded by the process of vulnerability management
* it is essential to know how vulnerability scans are conducted & the tools at hand today
* some popular scanning tools are **Nessus, Nexpose, & Acenetix**

### What is the Difference?
* **Vulnerability Scanning** is only a subset of **Vulnerability Management**
* **Vulnerability Management** aims to lower an organization's overall risk exposure by promtly identifying & mitigating as many vulnerabilities
* this is accomplished in part with **Vulnerability Scanning**

### Questions
1. What is the process that encompasses vulnerability scanning & other factors, such as risk acceptance?
```bash
Vulnerability Management
```
2. Is the overall objective of vulnerability management to increase an organization's risk exposure?
```bash
Nay
```


## Task 3: Vulnerability Classification
