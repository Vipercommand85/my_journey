## Task 1: Introduction
* **Vulnerability**: is defined by NIST as "_A weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source_"

## Learning Objectives
1. Vulnerability management vs Vulnerability Scanning
2. How are vulnerabilites classified?
3. Process of vulnerability management lifecycle
4. How can we use a vulnerability management framework in cybersecurity


## Task 2: Vulnerability Management vs Vulnerability Scanning
### Vulnerabilty Management
* is an ongoing, proactive, & frequent autmated activity
* it protects computer systems, networks, & enterprise solutions from cyberattacks & data breaches

### Vulnerability Scanning
* is surrounded by the process of vulnerability management
* it is essential to know how vulnerability scans are conducted & the tools at hand today
* some popular scanning tools are **Nessus, Nexpose, & Acenetix**

### What is the Difference?
* **Vulnerability Scanning** is only a subset of **Vulnerability Management**
* **Vulnerability Management** aims to lower an organization's overall risk exposure by promtly identifying & mitigating as many vulnerabilities
* this is accomplished in part with **Vulnerability Scanning**

### Questions
1. What is the process that encompasses vulnerability scanning & other factors, such as risk acceptance?
```bash
Vulnerability Management
```
2. Is the overall objective of vulnerability management to increase an organization's risk exposure?
```bash
Nay
```


## Task 3: Vulnerability Classification
* is generally viewed as open standard based approach employing **NIST** **Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)**
* primary components of **SCAP**:
    - **Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures (CVE)**: **MITRE** maintains the CVE list of publicly documented vulnerability exposures
    - each entry has a unique identifier, decription, & at least 1 public reference

### Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE)
* gives system configuration issues unique identifiers to quickly & accurately link configuration data from different information sources & tools

### Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)
* a method for classifying & identifying devices, OS, & application types inside an infrastructure
* widely used in security & vulnerability management tools to identify various assets & to take accurate automated action through correlation owith **CVE** & **CCE**

### Common Vulnerabilty Scoring System (CVSS)
* scoring system that rates the severity of vulnerabilities & identifies their characteristics
* used to prioritise mitigation efforts & the required resources based on severity

### What is the CVSS for CVE-2013-1048
```bash
4.6
```

### What is the Access Complexity for CVE-2013-1048?
```bash
Low
```

### With the fictional CVE-2023-2022, what would the CVE ID assign year be?
```bash
2023
```


## Vulnerability Management Life Cycle - Discover & Prioritise
### Step 1
* first step is to compile a list of all the environment's resources/assets
* this includes applications, services, OS, & configurations
* typucally combines both a network scan & a system scan 
* organizational wide scanning should be planned and executed regularly
