## Task 1: Introduction
* **Risk Avoidance**: the act of removing an asset from being able to be threatened by an attacker
* **Risk Acceptance**: having full knowledge of the risk and not implementing any controls to mitigate or eliminate the risk
* **Risk Reduction**: the act of providing controls to mitigate the likelyhood of an attack, impact from a successful attack, vulnerability in/to an asset

### If you bring a laptop with you in case your main laptop fails, what would you call this response to risk?
```bash
Risk Reduction
```

### If you decide not to take any futher actions because you feel the likleyhood of your laptop failing is slim since it has never failed before, what do you call this repsonse to risk?
```bash
Risk Acceptance
```


## Task 2: Basic Terminology
### Threat
* an intentional or accidental event that cam compromise the security of an information system
* *potential harm or danger* to an individual, organization, or system
### 3 Main Categories
### Human-made Threats
* Terrorism
* wars & conflicts
* riots & civil unrest
* cyberattacks
* industrial accidents
* arson
### Technical Threats
* power outages
* software & hardware failures
* data breaches
* netowrk & system vulnerabilities
* equipment malfunctions
### Natural Threats
* earthquakes
* floods
* hurricanes
* tornados
* blizzards

### Vulnerability
* a weakness in the system or software that can be exploited by a threat to cause harm

### Asset
* an economic resource owned or controlled by an individual, company, or government
* can include cash & cash equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, stock, equipment, real estate, & intellectual property

### Risk
* the probability of a *threat source* exploiting an exisitng *vulnerability (in an asset)* that results in adverse business effects
* the potential of encountering unforeseens events or circumstances that may lead to a loss, damage, or negative outcome
* in information systems, risk refers to the potential threats, vulnerabilities, and negative consequences arising from the interaction between IT infrastructure, software applications, data, and users

### Risk Management
* a process of identifying, assessing, & responding to risks associated with a particular situation or activity
* **Risk Management Policy**: is a set of procedures & processes designed to minimise the chances of an adverse event or outcome taking place
  - helps organizations identify, assess, & manage potential & actual risks related to their operations, financial activities, & compliance with applicable laws & regualtions
* **Information Systems Risk Management (ISRM)**: system of policies, procedures, & practices that seek to protect a company's computer system/network from various threats

### What do you call the potential for a loss or an incident that may harm the CIA of an organization's information assets?
```bash
Risk
```

### What do you call a weakness an attacker could exploit to gain unauthorized access to a system or data?
```bash
Vulnerability
```

## What do you consider a business latop?
```bash
Asset
```

### From a legal business perspective, what do you classify ransomware groups?
```bash
Threat
```


## Risk Assessment Methodologies
### NIST SP 800-30
* risk assessment methodology developed by the **National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST)**
* involves identifying & evaluating risks, determining the likelihood & impact of each risk, & developing a risk response plan

### Facilitated Risk Analysis Process (FRAP)
* risk assessment methodology that involves a group of stakeholders working together to identify & evaluate risks

### Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, & Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE)
* risk assessment methodology that focuses on identifying & prioritising assets based on their criticality to the organization's mission
* assessing threats & vulnerabilities that could impact those assets

### Failure Modes & Effect Analysis (FMEA)
* risk assessment mehtodology commonly used in engineering & manufacturing
* involves identifying potential failure modes for a system/process
* then analysing the possible effects of those failures & likelihood of their occurrence

### What is the name of the risk assessment methodology developed b y NIST?
```bash
NIST SP 800-30
```



## Task 4: Frame Risk
* risk management begins with establishing a risk context for the purpose of developing a risk management strategy
* the following must be identified to establish a reasonable risk fram:
### Risk Assumptions
* what are the assumptions about threats & vulnerabilities?
* what is the likelihood of occurance
* what would be the impact & consequences?

### Risk Constraints
* what are the limiting factors to assessing, responding, & monitoring risks?

### Risk Tolerance
* what are the acceptable levels of risk?
* what is the acceptable degree of risk uncertainty?

### Priorities & Trade-offs
* what are the high-priority business fucntions?
* what are the trade-offs among the different types of faced risks?


## Task 5: Assess Risk
* is the second step of risk mangement
* in this step you look to answer the following questions:
    - **Threats**: what are the threats that you need to cons![c2cab5ae8c38c4c5b827374692534b35](https://github.com/Vipercommand85/my_journey/assets/65506052/f6ae9f4a-26cc-4783-98e1-8f1b37aa84dc)
ider?
    - **Vulnerabilities**: what are the vulnerabilities that you have to deal with?
    - **Impact**: what would be the impact if a threat exploited a vulnerability?
    - **Likelihood**: what is the likelihood of this vulnerability being exploited?

### Threats
* **Physical Damage**: from natural causes to human-made
* **Outsider Threat**: actors that are not part of your organization looking to do harm to your systems 
* **Insider Threat**:  actors that are part of your organization looking to do harm to your systems  


## Task 6: Risk Analysis
* **Qualitative Risk Analysis**: is where we assiggn ratings to risk such as **_high_**, **_medium_**, & **_low_** or can be colored coordinated
* **Quantitative Risk Analysis**: is where we assign monetary values & use that as a basis for decision-making
