# Network Device Hardening

## Task 1: Introduction
### Learning Objectives
* Identifying & Mitigating Security Vulnerabilities
* Hardening Network Device Configurations
* implementing Security Best Practives


## Task 2: Common Threat Attack Vectors
### Difference between Network Devices & Endpoint Devices
* **Endpoint** devices refer to any device that can generate or consume data on a network, i.e. laptops, desktops, smartphones, tablets, etc.
    * are typically located at the edge of a network that users interact directly with
* **Network** devices refer to devices that manage the network traffic via routing/forwarding

### Common Threat & Attack Vectors of Network Devices
| **Threat** | Description | Attack Vector |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Unauthorized Access** | gain unauthorized control of a network device & then the complete network | * password attacks (brute force, dictionary & hybrid) |
|   |   | * exploit known vulnerabilities , i.e. **RCE** |
|   |   | * social engineering/Phishing attacks |
