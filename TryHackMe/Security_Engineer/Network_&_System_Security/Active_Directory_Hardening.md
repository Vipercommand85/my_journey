# Active Directory Hardening
## Task 1: Introduction
### Learing Objectives
* Secure Authetication Methods
* Securing hosts through Group Plocies
* Implementing Least Privilege Model
* Protecting against known AD Attacks
* Recovery Plan (Post-compromise scenario)

### Connecting to the Machine
* **IP**: ```[WILL BE PROVIDED]```
* **USERNAME**: ```Amdinistrator```
* **PASSWORD**: ```tryhackmewouldnotguess1@```

## Understanding General Active Directory Concepts
#### Domain
* acts as a core unit regarding the logical structure of the **_Active Directory_**
* initially stores all the critical information about the objects that belong to the domain only

#### Domain Controller
* is an **_AD_** server that acts as the brain for a Windows server domain (can also have Linux and MacOS endpoints)
* acts as a gatekeeper for users' **_Authentication_** & IT resources **_Authorisation_**

#### Trees
* are responsible for sharing resources between the domains
* communicatoin between domains inside of a **_Tree_** can be either **_one-way or two-way communication_**
* when a domain is added to a **_Tree_**, it becomes a **_Parent Domain_**
    * any subsequent domains added to this **_Parent Domains_** is an **_Offspring_**

#### Forests
* is when the sharing of the standard global catalogue, directory schema, logical structure, & directory configuration betweens the collection of trees

### Trust in AD
* is an established communication bridge between the domains in AD
* when trust is established, resources can be shared with other domain(s)
* **_AD Trusts_** are categorized in two ways:

#### What is the root domain in the attached AD machine?
```
tryhackme.loc
```


## Task 3: Securing Authentication Methods
### LAN Manager Hash
* instead of a user's password being stored in clear text, it is stored with 2 types of hash representation
* if the user's password is less than or equal to 15 characters, both **_LM Hash_** and **_NT Hash_** are generated by **_Windows_**
* **_LM Hash_** is weak and susceptible to brute force attacks
* best practice is to prevent **_Windows_** from storing the password's **_LM Hash_** with the following steps:
```
Group Policy Management Editor >
Computer Configuration >
Policies >
Windows Settings >
Security Settings >
Local Policies >
Security Options >
double click Network security - Do not store LM hash value on next password change policy >
select "Define policy setting"
```

### SMB Signing
* **_Server Message Block_** is generally utilized for **_Microsof_** networks to share file and print communication
* it allows for secure tansmission over the network
* configuring **_SMB Signing_** is crucial to detect **_Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM)_** attacks
* this feature ensures integrity of both data and client
* this can be configured by the following steps:
```
Group Policy Management Editor >
Computer Configuration >
Policies >
Windows Settings >
Security Settings >
Local Policies >
Security Options >
double click Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communication (always) >
select Enable Digitally Sign Communications
```

### LDAP Signing
* **_Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)_** enables locating & **_Authenticating_** resources in a network
* also susceptible to **_MiTM_** attacks
* is a **_Simple AUthentication & Security Layer (SASL)_** that only accepts signed **_LDAP_** request and ignores other requests
* this can be configured by the following:
```
Group Policy Management Editor >
Computer Configuration >
Policies >
Windows Settings >
Security Settings >
Local Policies >
Security Options >
Domain controller: LDAP server signing requirements >
select Require signing from the dropdown
``` 

### Password Rotation
#### First Technique
* creating a script to update passwords automatically in the **_Scheduled Task_** with the help of **_PowerShell_**
* does not require additional overhead & removes all the manual efforts for password rotation
* does require you to write & maintain your script

#### Second Technique
* add a **_Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)_** solution to **_AD_**
* adds an additional layer of security & users will not need to change their passwords as often

#### Third Technique
* use the **_Microsoft_** provided solution for services account password rotation through **_Group Managed Services Accounts (gMSAs)
* this will change passwords every 30 days

### Password Policies
* critical to maintain a strict password policy to help defend against various attacks
* you can modify the default password policy in **_Group Policy Management Editor_** with the following steps:
```
Group Policy Management Editor >
Computer Configuration >
Policies >
Windows Settings >
Security Settings >
Account Policies >
Password Policy
```

### Understanding Password Policy Settings
* **Enforce Password History**: prevents users from using at least 10 to 15 previous passwords
* **Minimum Password Length**: should be between 10 to 14 characters
* **Complexity Requirements**: must not contain the name of the user account & ensures the password has uppercase, lowercase letters, digits, & special characters

#### What is the default minimum password length in the attached VM?
```
7
```

## Task 4: Implementing Least Privilege Model
* requires limiting the user or application access to minimise security risks & attack surface
* users & applications should only be given the needed permissions to carry out tasks though authorised access per current conditions

### Creating the Right Type of Accounts
* **User Accounts**: promote using regular user accounts for most people in the network to perform regular duties
* **Privilege Accounts**: accounts with elevated privileges that are classified as **First** & **Second** privilege accounts
* **Shared Accounts**: are shared amongst a group of people, i.e. visitors with bare minimum privileges
     * are not recommended and should only be utilised in limited scenarios

### Role-Based Access Control on Hosts
* allows you to indicate access privileges at different levels
* includes DNS zone, server, or resource record level & specifies who has access control over createing, editiing, & deleting operations of various resources in AD

### Tiered Access Model (TAM)
* comprises of technical controls that reduce the privilege escalation risks
* consists of a logical structure that seperates AD's assets by creating boundaries for security purposes
* primary goal is the protection of AD's top-valued identities (**_Tier 0_**)
* comprised of 3 tiers:
     * **Tier 0**: top level & includes all the admin accounts, DC, & groups
     * **Tier 1**: domain member applications & servers
     * **Tier 2**: end-user devices like HR & sales staff (non-IT personnel)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3807fc49-3939-48e7-bd35-b235fdaebb1e)


### Implementation of Tiered Acces Model
* **_"Prevention of privileged credentials from crossing boundaries, either accidentally or intentionally"_** is the critical implementation of this model
* implementing technical controls via **GPOs** is crucial to avoid such scenarios

### Auditing Accounts
* is a crucial task mainly carried out by setting up the correct account, assinging privilegesm & applying restrictions
* there are 3 audit types related to accounts must be done periodically
     * **Usage**: allow monitoring of each account's specific tasks, & validating their access rights
     * **Privilege**: allows you to check if every account in the system has the least privilege
     * **Change**: allows you to look for any improper changes to account permissions, passwords, or settings


#### Computers & Printers must be added to Tier ) - yay/nay?
```
nay
```

#### Should you create a high privilege account for a system administrator from a vendor that is coming to the facility for a 2 week duration task?
```
nay
```


## Task 5: Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit
* is an officail toolkit provided by Micorsoft to implement & manage local & domain-level policies
* the toolkit provides pre-developed security baselines per the end user environment
* download link [**MSCT**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319)

### Installing Security Baselines
* can be easily downloaded as a zip file and extracted
```
Open Microsoft Security Compliance Website >
click Download >
click Windows Servers Security Baseline.zip >
Download >
Extract contents to desire folder
```
```
Open extracted folder >
select desired baseline & execute with PowerShell
```

### Polciy Analyser
* allows comparison of group policies to quickly check for inconsistencies, redundant settings, & the alterations that need to be made between them
* these baselines should only be downloaded from the official **Microsoft** website


#### Can you find the flag in the BaseLineLocalInstall?
```
THN{00001}
```

#### Can you find the flag in the MergePolicyRule (Polciy Analyser) script?
```
{THM00191}
```


## Taks 6: Protecting Against Known Attacks
### Kerboroasting
* is a common & successful post-exploitation technique for attackers to get privileged access to AD
* attacker exploits **Kerboros Ticker Granting Service (TGS)** to request an encrypted password that is then cracked offline
* difficult to detect as the request is made through an approved user so there is no unusual traffic
* you can mitigate this by adding **MFA** or frequent & periodic **Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)** service account password reset

### Weak & Easy-to-Guess Passwords
* easiest target for an adversay is cracking easy-to-guess passwords
* enforce strict and strong password policy

### Brute Forcing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
* never expose **RDP** to the public without additional security controls
* perform continuous audits for scanning attacks & brute-force attempts

### Publically Accessible Share
* use ```Get-SmbOpenFile``` cmdlet in **PowerShell** to look for any undesired shares on the network & configure access accordingly

#### Does Kerboroasting utilise an offline-attack scheme for cracking encrytped passwords - yay/nay?
```
yay
```

#### How many users have the same password as aaron.booth in the generated report?
```
186
```
