# Cyber Kill Chain

## Task 1: Introduction
* **Kill Chain** is a military concept related to the structure of an attack that consists of target identification, decision and order to attack the target, and finnaly the target destruction
* **Cyber Kill Chain Framework** was established by **Lockhead Martin**, a global security and aerospace company

**Recon ==> Weaponization ==> Delivery ==> Exploitation ==> Installation ==> Command & Control ==> Actions on Objectives**


## Task 2: Reconnaissance
* **Reconnaisance:** is discovering and collecting information on the system and the victim, planning phase for the adversaries
* **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)** falss under reconnaisance and is the fist step an attacker needs to complete to carry out the further phases of an attack
* **Email Harvesting:** is the process of obtaining email address from public, paid, or free services
  * these emails can be used for **phishing attacks**, type of social engineering attack used to steal sensitive information through emails
  * some tools include:
    
    1.[theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) capable of gathering names, subdomains, IPs, URLs and emails using multiple public data sources
    
    2.[Hunter.io](https://hunter.io) email hunting tool that will let you obtain contact information associated with the domain
    
    3.[OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com) provides the collection of OSINT tools based on various catagories
  
### Questions:
**What is the name of the Intel Gathering Tool that is a web-based interface to the common tools and resources for open-source intelligence?**
```
OSINT Framework
```
**What is the definition of the email gathering process during the stage of reconnaissance?**
```
Email Harvesting
```

## Task 3: Weaponization
* adveraries would craft a weapon without interacting directly with the victim by utilizing a "waeponizer" that combines **malware** and **exploit** into a deliverable **payload**
* most attackers would use automated tools to generate the malware or purchase of the DarkWeb
* Nation State APT's would write their own custom malware to make it unique to evade detection on the target
* **Malware:** a program or software that is designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer
* **Exploit:** is a program or a code that takes advantage of the vulnerability or flaw in the application or system
* **Payload:**
