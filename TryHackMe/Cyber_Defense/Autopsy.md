# AUTOPSY
## Task1: Introduction
Autopsy is an open-source and powerful digital forensics platform.
Several features within Autopsy have been developed by the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology funding. 

The official description:
  "Autopsy is the premier open source forensics platform which is fast, easy-to-use, and capable of analysing all types of mobile devices and digital media.
  Its plug-in architecture enables extensibility from community-developed or custom-built modules.
  Autopsy evolves to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of professionals in law enforcement, national security, litigation support, and corporate investigation."
  
## Task 2: Work Flow
Basic Workflow:
1. Create/open the case for the data source you will investigate
2. Select the data source you wish to analyze
3. Configure the ingest modules to extract artefacts from the data source
4. Review the artifacts extracted by the ingest modules
5. Create the report

**What is the file extension of the Autpsy files?**
```
.aut
```

## Task 3: Data Sources
Autposy can analyze multiple disk image formats as follows:
1. **Raw Single**: .img, .dd, .raw, .bin
2. **Raw Split**: .001, .002, .aa, .ab, etc.
3. **EnCase**: .e01, .e02, etc.
4. **Virtual Machines**: .vmdk, .vhd

* if there are multiple image files ( ie. E01, E02, E03, etc.) Autopsy only mneeds you to point to the first image file

**What is the disk image name of the "e01" format?**
```
EnCase
```

## Task 4: Ingest Modules
Essentially Ingest Modules are Autopsy plug-ins.
Each Ingest Module is designed to analyse and retrieve specific data from the drive.
You can configure Autopsy to run specific modules during the source-adding stage or later by choosing the target data source available on the dashboard. By default, the Ingest Modules are configured to run on All Files, Directories, and Unallocated Space.
You can change this setting during the module selecting step.
You can track the process with the bar appearing in the lower right corner.

* Using ingest modules after adding data sources:
1. Open the _"Run Ingest Modules"_ menu by right-clicking on the data source
2. Chosse the module to implement and click on the finsih button
3. Track the progress of implementation

* results of any **_Ingest Module_** will populate in the Results node of the tree view
* as and **_Ingest Module_** runs, alerts will appear in the **_Ingest Inbox_**

## Task 5: The User Interface I
### Tree Viewer
Comprised of **five top-level nodes:**
  * **Data Sources** - all the data will be organised as you would typically see it in a normal Windows File Explorer
  * **View** - files will be organised based on file type, MIME types, file size, etc.
  * **Results** - results from ingest modules
  * **Tags** - will displat files and/or results that have been tagged 
  * **Repoerts** - will display reports either generated by modules or the analyst
### Result Viewer
* not to be confused with the **_Results_** node
* the pane to the right of the tree view that will show additional information about a selected volume, fodler, file, etc.
* has 3 tabs: **Table, Thumbnail, Summary**
* **Thumbnail** works best with image or video files
* **Views** node will categorise files by type - **_by extension, MIME type, deleted files, and file sieze_**
* when it comes to file types, it is wise to pay close attention as adversaries could rename a file with a misleading file extension as way to obfuscate some malicious files
* instead use **_MIME_** type, this will categorise all files appropriately

### Contents Viewer
* **S = Score** will show a red eclamation point for a folder/file marked/tagged as notable and a yellow triangle pointing downward for a folder/file marked/tagged as suspicious
* **C = Comment** will have a yellow page in this field indicating that there is a comment for the selected item
* **O = Occurrence** will indicate how many times this file/folder has been seen in the past cases ( this will require the Central Repository)

### Keyword Search
* allows an investigator to perform an ad-hoc search of the desired string
* results will appear in the main pane

### Status Area
* progress bar at the bottom right corner that will give a status of a running process

**Expand the "Data Sources" option; what is the number of available sources?**
```
4
```
**What is the number of the detected "Removed" files?**
```
10
```
**What is the filename found under the "Interesting Files" section?**
```
googledrivesync.exe
```

## Task 6: User Interface II

### Data Sources Summary
* if you right click on the name of a data source, there wil be an option for summary report

### Generate Report
* allows you to create a report in multiple formats that contains all the information that was present in the **Results Viewer** pane
* these can be helpful on systems with low resources, however, there is not an additional search option, so a specific artifact will need to be searched for manually
* can be found in the main action bar above the results viewer

**What is the full name of the operating system version?**
```
Windows 7 Ultimate Service Pack 1
```
**What percentage of the drive are documents?**
```
40.8%
```
**What is the job number of the "Interesting Files Identifier" module on the report?**
```
10
```

## Data Analysis
**What is the name of an Installed Program with the version number of 6.2.0.2962?**
```
Eraser
```
**A user has a Password Hint. What is the value?**
```
IAMAN
```
**What was the IP address that accessed numerous _SECRET_ files on a network drive?**
```
10.11.11.128
```
**What web search term has the most entries?**
```
information leakage cases
```
**What was the web search conducted on 3/25/2015 21:46:44?**
```
anti-forensics tools
```
**What MD5 hash value of the binary is listed as an Interesting File?**
```
fe18b02e890f7a789c576be8abccdc99
```
**What self-assuring message did the 'Informant' write for himself on a Sticky Note?**
* need to look in missmatch extension for .snt
