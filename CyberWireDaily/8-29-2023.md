## Cisco Talos
* have described risks posed by **DNS Name Collision**
* **DNS Name Collision** occurs when an internal private DNS name overlaps with a public top level domain **TLD** name
* controlled interuption is one way to mitigate this risk as proposed by **Name Collision Management Framework**
* **Controlled Interuption** is when a TLD publishes DNS records at the root level to provide information about the domain
* if a network uses an internal name that overlaps with one of these TLDs, a DNS reply will be sent stating:
  - your DNS needs immediate attention .TLD
* a critical peice of information that was left out the **NCMF** was that the TLD must ensure that the name is not available for public registration
* Talos was able to register **yourdnsneedsimmediateattention.kids** and setup a internet server to log all internet activity
* there were many requests from systems running **Microsoft's System Center Configuration Manager**
* this allowed Talos to masquarade as a trusted system
* networks using the .kids TLD were tricked into trusting the system sending internal email, change configuration management settings, and more
