## Security Joes
* have found that a threat actor was exploiting 2 vulnerabilities in the distributed object storage system **MinIO** to steal data & execute arbitrary code
* the vulnerabilities have been patched at this time
* the attack was carried out by a phishing attack in which a developer was tricked into reverting the service to an earlier version
* the attackers were then able to access an adminstative console which allowed them to push an update that contained exploit code
* the executed commands inherit the system permissions of the user that intiated the application
* because if security flaws, the dev op engineer launching the application held root level permissions

## Okta Security
* has warned of an on going social engineering campaign that's targeting IT employees to gain access to super admin perms
